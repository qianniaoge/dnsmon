# DNSMON

The RIPE NCC DNS Monitoring Service (DNSMON) provides a comprehensive, objective and up-to-date overview of the quality of the service offered by high-level Domain Name System (DNS) servers. It is an active measurement service. It uses our RIPE Atlas active measurement network to provide an up-to-date service overview of all DNS root and many Top-Level Domain (TLD) name servers. An important feature is the ability to view historical data. This allows quick analysis of both past and present DNS issues.

DNSMON measures DNS performance between site that host RIPE Atlas anchors and those where DNS servers are installed. The high number of probes and the method of presenting the results are unique. The information is updated as soon as new data points are received.
